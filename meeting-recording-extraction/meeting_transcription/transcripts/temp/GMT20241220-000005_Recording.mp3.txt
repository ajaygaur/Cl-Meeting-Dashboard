to believe the injuries affecting what's being proposed in terms of variance is exactly what's the solutionprovisions of the development place what is previous compliancean opportunities for republicanthank you for the presentation and thank you again for engineering Canada what is the motivation to check the lot size in our community in general I have feedback from resonance and saying that developed countrywhat do you mean by larger or larger than 28 feet and so what is the primary motivation for shrinking the large size and then I don't want you to Professor to see the portable housing because I know you can go down that and you make it smaller courses can be cheaper than more affordable there is no question there but is it for profit making purposes and I do I know if you want to make the most profit that's what you doyeah I know that corresponds directly to the price the price points about offering a diverse range of housing options and price pointswe didn't hear about the WhatsAppconflicts or receive conflicts between the new development and what they are already design so that there is an open space buffer between any existing development developed like anything has been proposed the second issue is that there have been a number of subdivisions of provident in the surrounding area that you have to explainquestions to that you introduce on your PowerPoint slide item 7097 subsection 1B and subsection 2 versus it would be detrimental to the area Residency infrastructure forwouldn't be detrimental so under the year as you referred to it has not going to be different as well as the added cost for infrastructure I know you are taking on some of the infrastructure classyou don't see in the first three years of years that itself City right so I just want to see what you response with thank you yeah pointsand will be presented there and what the municipal board grid with those things happen you dress on terms of the highway there is a requirement for you in your subdivision approval that was imposed by mental transportation infrastructure developmentpotential adverse effects of something that's arguments on both sides and industrial engineering a similar story with the water and western constructionin concert with administration based on other requirements of Englishyou know it's winter time in congestion right now I understand your problem and I know it's actually not even your arms problem but transportation has to do something with Google products but as I said increasethank you like you said that one of the people living in the work in the area would be affected by the help ofpotential development in the surrounding areas ultimately you need to make a decision on I would say that in general designed this development with consideration certainly for the resistanceis the correct concept to be you knowsomething that is one example properties in that subdivision we certainly taken steps to accommodate and to address the concerns by people living in the surrounding area and also been proposed in this departmentopen space and Pathways that you can be Public School I would say beyond not being injurious and properties I would go beyond and say this is actually a benefit5:15 that's why they have no objections to news about hearing they said they don't have consideration about because they was constant on about reasoning not about Highways being development hearing that we have thepresentation down to earth at 5:15 and those areas that yes please transportation am I had a lot of serious concerns on access to 15 or pr26 that shouldsubstitution was circulated in the specially when we were working on the working through the development plan has been brought up at the subdivision stage the only condition that the permanent Highways am I at least twice they wanted to traffic impact assessment which I believe is working on now and we won't have it becausecondition is a condition by the problems so what's up to the process of their willing to share with us but I believe it's not even finalized do you have that information from the empty to access the highway 15 taxtalk about the specifically and there is no concerns of formulas and applications of again there is a traffic impact study requiredhow you gonna get construction equipment or materials to the development in India welding connected to highway so doesn't run through any of the existing developed areas in terms of construction access that will be something with work divisionfor construction and that could be something that you stipulationsthe last thing I need is how much construction Truck School and the concerned to me with that is more with the highway and the exit on 15 that that would take place in the mean time because I don't want to know you are looking so of may be bring the construction and from the south of those thingsok thank you also comments and concerns there is currently a barricade at the end of January that could remain in place until such a time there is always infrastructure in place and can even possibly be there for a period of time where there someso that could be monitored through the development agreement thank you enquiryhello my name is Salman Khan's presidentVasudev planet just finishing development of traffic study impact study in place that impact studies in a place for how long is one questions because I had sent an email to your office requested to copy and I knowany hack study is required from the problems but it also can be one of our requirements cannot be a question and answerso traffic in Bangalore to the problems I believe it was 2020 and so that's not hasn't been finalized once it has been fine linesthe traffic impacts that he was not requirements and professional road or pth 15 or not Municipal jurisdictions the only traffic that is within the round development you're looking at traffic on the outside we don't even have controlso there's no point asking for traffic impact assessment on the jurisdiction we don't even have but right now they do not have access of employee has stated that they do not allow any excess of 215 and their only existingIndia versus 215 15 and therefore that would mean that they would have to turn into one of the person to existing accesses like for instance down by the school turn on across 15 and thereport that they would not grant access 1 to 15 I'm not sure where you got your information Access 125 is so right now the only existing access that they can use for trucks inwhat is to go through Jeffrey because there's been nothing but no problemis that a detailed drainage plan be prepared by qualified expert engineer has advanced conditions of the subdivision and if that doesn't get satisfied then theok perfect confirmation when we're talking about the variances and what's going to be approved Tonight It's not on the whole development is strictly on Phase 1 of which the municipal board has givenso give the approval on the subdivision and its only for Phase 1 for these words line nothing in the audience enquiryspiral bank I can confirm that Highway any access from 1250 so three that has to be resolvedresolution of any access on to 26 and ability of I have difficulties with your ideas traffic study should include the potential axiswhat's the weather condition please idea that jurisdictions are play here is something that we need to take charge on ourselves I know for a fact that Jeffrey has been 4.2 residence especially especially as a lot of traffic directtraffic particular access 26 and consideration of what the followingschool buses and people dropping in children sector and so this will only be automatically increase when we put Instagramtap with long Jeffrey it does not have a side walk as it stands now and this has been born in contention for the people that live there and have children accessories moving a major component of traffic traffictraffic movies I am saying sorry I didn't The Other questions are not sure how you get access to skylight developmentso we were looking at the evening is a variance for Siberian site with diving into the area of the subdivision conditions on traffic movements this conceptual plan only deals with Phase 1 so what are the traffic will be going directly to pth 15 this isthe patient engineer drawings that we have been received at their pedestrian corridors are sidewalks all within the engineer drawings that we will be receiving information and when you got this family residential area component of a family making4.1 we have reduce the size of the last mainly and were getting into the traffic which is not working and reducethe route crossing across on January looking with empty tickettalking approving this kind of project then the ratio corresponding to actually Access on Geography questionsdevelopment plan to get into the details of that you are asking about business questionswhat area in which administrationI am going on the information that this matter be resolved before we proceed and okcartoon in area for the area before I think that we basically got a situation coming our way we don't have a restriction on the size of a house that can go on a reduced lot and to meet us in 40 with your spaces in severely the management toI am looking at the residential and multicellular I don't see a provision therefore players for their children to have actually space to get rid ofwhat is history and as for kids playing I don't think that's really it's nearby nearbysize buildings on the light energy you see from the presentation and they show the different kinds of houses types we need to specify that a house for friend should not be very such that it over subscribernew slide by 30% then you have to have a household print that reduce we got the last sizes and then we have rules for setbacks and so on so I knowmy observation is in the document and to reduce that is going to be a consideration should be in play thank youhello Wi-Fi connect
